# Human vs Zombie

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/standard--readme-OK-green.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

C# .NET project delivery for the Case assignment at Noroff. It reproduces the functionality requested in the HvZ Case assignment file, as well as creating a web api in .Net core.

The Focus of the API is based on the HvZ game. It contains models to make it possible to communicate every necessary endpoint needed. It has a Game that can have several players and has a gameconfig connected to it. These players can belong to a squad and also communicate with the global, faction and squad chat if they belong to one. If the player dies a gravestone will be created. Also the game can contain a mission

If any of the web requests fail. For example, user queries for a single game with an ID (queried as a parameter in the URL) that is not present in the database return correct status codes, in this case 404, as well as verbose error messages.
